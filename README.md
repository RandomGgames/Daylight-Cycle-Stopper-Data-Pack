# Daylight Cycle Stopper
This data pack makes it so that when a player is not on a server, the daylight cycle and weather cycles stop, freezing the time of day and stopping the weather from changing until a player is online again.

# How to use
This data pack takes over the use of the `/gamerule doDaylightCycle` command. If you use it, it will reset after a moment with how the data pack works. To regain functionaly, disable the data pack, but don't forget to re-enable it.
